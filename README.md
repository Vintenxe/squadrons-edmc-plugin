# Squadrons Telemetry — EDMC Plugin

An [EDMarketConnector](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector) plugin that
streams Elite Dangerous journal events from your client to your squadron's
instance of [Elite Squadrons](https://elitesquadrons.com).

The plugin is **squadron-scoped and authenticated**: each member generates a
personal API token in the Squadrons web app, pastes it into the plugin
settings, and from that point on every supported event you generate in-game
flows directly into your squadron's data.

---

## What the plugin does

The plugin forwards a fixed set of journal events to
`POST /api/v1/telemetry/ingest` on your Squadrons server. Nothing else is
sent: no chat, no friends list, no system map data — just the journal
events listed below.

### BGS / movement
- `FSDJump`, `Location` — refresh faction influence in your squadron's
  tracked systems and update your "current system" in the member
  directory.

### Stations
- `Docked` — keeps the station catalog (type, services, pads, controlling
  faction) up to date for stations you visit, including fleet carriers.

### Markets, outfitting, shipyards
- `Market`, `Outfitting`, `Shipyard` — full live snapshots of commodity
  prices, modules for sale, and ships for sale at the station you're
  docked at. Listings are replaced on each visit, not appended.

### Fleet carriers (full lifecycle)
- `CarrierJump`, `CarrierJumpRequest`, `CarrierJumpCancelled`,
  `CarrierLocation` — schedule, cancel, complete, and reconcile carrier
  jumps. Live telemetry is the strongest source for jump and location
  data.
- `CarrierStats`, `CarrierDepositFuel` — tritium level and stats
  (services, docking access, name).
- `CarrierTradeOrder` — purchase/sale/cancel orders for commodities on
  your carrier.
- `CarrierNameChanged`, `CarrierDockingPermission`, `CarrierCrewServices`
  — rename, docking-access changes, and individual service activations.
- `CarrierDecommission`, `CarrierCancelDecommission` — decommission
  scheduling and cancellation.

### What you get in return
- Live BGS influence in your squadron's tracked-system dashboards.
- A live fleet-carrier view with up-to-date location, fuel, services,
  docking access, jump schedule, and trade orders.
- Squadron-scoped market / outfitting / shipyard intelligence for the
  stations your squadron visits.
- A squadron-attributed location for you in the member directory.

The plugin **does not** perform proof-of-participation enrolment, conflict
zone tracking, or operation auto-tagging. Those are not part of v1.x.

## Requirements

- [EDMarketConnector](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector) **5.x or
  later** (Python 3; the plugin uses the `plugin_start3` entry point).
- An account on an Elite Squadrons instance (e.g.
  <https://elitesquadrons.com>) with permission to generate telemetry
  tokens.
- Python standard library only — no extra packages to install.

---

## Install

EDMC plugins are loose Python folders dropped into EDMC's plugin
directory. There is no installer.

1. Download the latest release:
   - Go to the
     [Releases page](https://github.com/Vintenxe/squadrons-edmc-plugin/releases)
     and grab the `SquadronsTelemetry-vX.Y.Z.zip` asset from the most
     recent release.
   - Or, if you prefer, download the repository itself as a ZIP via
     **Code → Download ZIP** on the GitHub page. You'll need to rename
     the extracted folder to `SquadronsTelemetry`.
2. Extract the archive. You should end up with a folder called
   `SquadronsTelemetry` that contains `squadrons_telemetry.py`.
3. Move that `SquadronsTelemetry` folder into EDMC's plugin directory:
   - **Windows:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EDMarketConnector\plugins`
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/EDMarketConnector/plugins`
   - **Linux:** `~/.local/share/EDMarketConnector/plugins`
4. The final path should look like
   `…/EDMarketConnector/plugins/SquadronsTelemetry/squadrons_telemetry.py`.
5. Restart EDMC. The plugin appears in
   **File → Settings → Plugins** as **Squadrons Telemetry**.

### Updating

Delete the old `SquadronsTelemetry` folder, drop the new one in its place,
and restart EDMC. Your server URL and API token are stored inside the
plugin folder in `config.json`; if you want to keep them across updates,
copy that file into the new folder before restarting.

## Create a telemetry token

Tokens are per-device. If you play on more than one PC, generate one token
per device so you can revoke a single device without breaking the others.

1. Sign in to your squadron on your Elite Squadrons instance (e.g.
   <https://elitesquadrons.com>).
2. Open **Settings → Telemetry Clients**.
3. Click **New Client** and give it a memorable name (e.g. *Gaming PC*).
4. Copy the token that appears. **It is shown once.** If you lose it,
   revoke that client and create a new one — there is no way to recover
   an existing token.

Tokens have the format `sq_<48 hex chars>`.

---

## Configure the plugin

1. Open EDMC → **File → Settings → Squadrons Telemetry**.
2. **Server URL** defaults to `https://elitesquadrons.com`. If your
   squadron runs its own instance, set this to that URL. A trailing
   slash is fine; it is stripped automatically.
3. Paste your token into **API Token**.
4. Click **OK** to save.

The plugin batches events for up to 10 seconds (or 30 events) before
sending. On a send failure, unsent events are buffered locally (capped at
100) and retried on the next flush. Short-fused carrier events
(`CarrierJumpRequest`, `CarrierJumpCancelled`, `CarrierJump`) skip the
buffer window and are flushed immediately.

### Verify it's working

After your next FSDJump or Docked event, return to the Squadrons web app:

- **Settings → Telemetry Clients** — the client row should show a
  `Last used` timestamp and a non-zero event count.
- **Carriers / BGS / Stations** — recently observed data should reflect
  the events you just generated.

If `Last used` never updates, see Troubleshooting below.

## Source precedence (where this fits)

Authenticated direct telemetry sits above passive EDDN scrapes for the
domains the plugin affects, because the server trusts an authenticated
squadron member's first-party events more than anonymous community data:

| Domain          | Highest                          | Notes                                                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| BGS faction     | `MANUAL_OVERRIDE` > `MANUAL_ENTRY` > **`SQUAD_TELEMETRY`** > `FRONTIER_CAPI` > `EDDN` > `EDSM` | Telemetry beats EDDN; manual edits beat both.        |
| Galaxy / market | `FRONTIER_CAPI` > `MANUAL` > **`SQUAD_TELEMETRY`** > `EDDN` > `SPANSH` > `EDSM` | cAPI snapshots are still strongest for market data. |
| Carrier live    | **`SQUAD_TELEMETRY`** > `EDDN` > `FRONTIER_CAPI` > `MANUAL` (location, jumps, fuel, decommission) | Live signals belong to telemetry.                    |
| Carrier static  | `MANUAL` / `FRONTIER_CAPI` > `SQUAD_TELEMETRY` (owner, services, displayName) | Curator/cAPI authoritative for slow-changing fields. |

Precedence is set by the server and is not configurable per client.

## Troubleshooting

**`Last used` never updates / no events showing up**
- Confirm the Server URL is reachable from your machine
  (`https://<your-instance>/api/health` should return `{ "ok": true }`).
- Confirm the token is the full `sq_…` value with no whitespace.
- Confirm you're not running the Elite Dangerous beta client — beta
  journals are intentionally ignored by the plugin (`is_beta` guard).
- Check EDMC's log via **Help → Open Log Folder** and look for lines
  from `Squadrons Telemetry`.

**`401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` in the EDMC log**
- `401`: the token was revoked (visible in **Settings → Telemetry
  Clients** in the web app), or was mistyped.
- `403`: the client is no longer authorized — e.g. it was disabled, or
  your squadron membership changed.
- In both cases the plugin drops the current batch and does not keep
  retrying a dead credential. Re-check the client in the Squadrons web
  app, recreate or re-authorize it, paste the new token into the plugin
  settings, and restart EDMC.

**`426 Upgrade Required` in the EDMC log**
- Your plugin version is below the server's minimum. Download the
  latest release from the
  [Releases page](https://github.com/Vintenxe/squadrons-edmc-plugin/releases).

**`429 Rate limit exceeded`**
- Default is 60 requests/minute per client. Each batch is one request,
  so you should never hit this in normal play.
- If you do, leave the plugin alone for a minute and it will resume.

**Worried about a leaked token?**
- Revoke it from **Settings → Telemetry Clients** — the row is rejected
  immediately on the next request.
- Create a new client with a new token and update the plugin settings.

## Versioning & compatibility

The plugin follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Each
release is tagged and published under
[Releases](https://github.com/Vintenxe/squadrons-edmc-plugin/releases);
see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed.

Every request includes an `X-Plugin-Version` header so the server can
record the running version per client. Today this is advisory only — no
versions are blocked. Future server releases may reject below a minimum
version with `426 Upgrade Required`; the plugin logs a clear message and
asks you to upgrade when that happens.

---

## Privacy

- The plugin only sends the journal events listed above. It does not
  read your save game, your Frontier login, your friends list, or
  anything outside the EDMC journal stream.
- Events are scoped to your squadron via your authenticated token.
  Other squadrons cannot see your data.
- Tokens are stored hashed (SHA-256) on the server. Only the prefix is
  visible afterwards.
- You can revoke a token at any time from the Squadrons web app.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) if you need to report a security issue.
